## User stories:
1. I can get the image URLs, alt text and page urls for a set of images relating to a given search string.
2. I can paginate through the responses by adding a ?offset=2 parameter to the URL.
3. I can get a list of the most recently submitted search strings.

## Example query usage:

```
https://spark-ogre.glitch.me/api/search/cats?offset=2
https://spark-ogre.glitch.me/api/recent
```
